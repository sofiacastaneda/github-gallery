GitHub Gallery is a simple photo gallery, which simply displays all the images it finds in the /images/ folder. It's powered by the Jekyll blog engine, and will work on any such powered pages, for example [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Images will display up to a max width of 900 pixels. Images larger than 900 pixels will show their full size if you click it.

You can link to a specific image as they're link anchored. Just click on the specific image and copy the browser URL.

## Setting up on GitHub
There are two simple steps:

* [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). It's free.
* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [GitHub Gallery repository](https://github.com/mikelothar/github-gallery).
* [Add an image](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) into the /images/ folder. 

Your GitHub Gallery should shortly after be available at [https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/github-gallery/](http://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/github-gallery/).

You can ofcourse [delete the old images](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-files/), as well as [renaming your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-repository/) for a prettier url.
